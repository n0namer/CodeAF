// Package remote is the wire between a surface on one machine and an engine on
// another. The surface half dials `ssh <host> codeaf engine …` and speaks this
// protocol over the pipes; the engine half wraps an ordinary *session.Agent and
// answers. Both halves import THIS file and nothing of each other.
//
// THE CONTRACT IS THE ENVELOPE, NOT THE PAYLOADS. Payloads are the session
// package's own types carried as JSON — both ends compile against
// internal/session, so a field added there travels without a wire change. The
// one exception is [EventWire], because error does not survive encoding/json.
//
// Frames are JSON, one per line (a journal's own framing, for a journal's own
// reason: a torn write is one lost line, not a lost stream).

// Version is the protocol's version. The hello and the welcome both carry it,
// and a mismatch is a refusal at the door — two builds that might disagree
// about a frame must not guess at each other.
//
// VERSION 2 IS THE PERSISTENT ENGINE. Version 1 married a conversation to a
// pipe: the engine was `ssh … codeaf engine`, it read frames on stdin, and when
// the pipe died so did the turn in flight. Version 2 separates the two — a
// session lives on the engine machine and a surface ATTACHES to it — and the
// four things that separation needs are the whole of the delta:
//
//   - [Frame.Seq] numbers every event of a stream, and [Hello.Resume] says
//     which ones a returning surface already has, so a reattach replays the
//     gap instead of the conversation.
//   - [MethodDetach] tells the engine a surface is leaving ON PURPOSE, which is
//     the fact version 1 could not express: a torn pipe and a closed window
//     were one event, so both had to interrupt the turn to be safe.
//   - [SubmitFilesArgs] and [MethodFetchFile] carry a person's attachments both
//     ways, generalizing the one payload version 1 already remade on arrival
//     (image.go).
//   - [HeldQuestion] lets a card raised with nobody attached WAIT rather than
//     expire, which is what turns half the --host refusals from "the card would
//     land in an empty room" into an answered question.
//
// EVERY VERSION-2 FIELD IS ADDITIVE AND OMITEMPTY, so a version-2 frame read by
// a version-1 decoder is a version-1 frame. That does not make the versions
// compatible — the door still refuses a mismatch, and it must, because a
// version-1 engine would silently interrupt a turn the surface believed was
// detached — but it does mean this file stayed a superset rather than becoming
// a second protocol.
// VERSION 4 IS THREE THINGS THAT LANDED IN ONE WAVE, AND THEY SHARE A NUMBER
// because nobody ever ran a build with only one of them.
//
// THE PLACES FOLLOW THE SESSION'S MACHINE. A place is a
// listing of one machine's disk — the conversations, the work they ran, what
// was learned, what it cost — and every one of them was read under the SURFACE's
// process, which over a connection is the laptop while the conversation lives on
// the server. Version 4 adds the doors that let the surface ask the machine that
// owns the work instead ([MethodPlacesWorld] and its neighbours), and one field
// on the welcome saying which state root those answers were read under.
//
// AND THE ROOM HAS ONE KEYBOARD. Version 2 let several surfaces attach
// to one conversation and version 3 left it at that: every one of them could
// type, and the only arbiter was the engine's own "a turn is already running"
// refusal — so two windows on one conversation raced, and neither screen said
// the other existed. Version 4 names a DRIVER, and the whole delta is three
// things:
//
//   - [Hello.Surface] carries the surface machine's short name, so a screen can
//     say WHICH window has the keyboard rather than that some window does.
//   - [Welcome.Driver] and the "driver" frame say who holds it, told to each
//     surface as that surface should read it, and the engine is the only thing
//     that decides.
//   - [MethodTake] moves it here in one round trip, and [Hello.Back] is how a
//     surface that merely lost its link says "I am not a new window" — because
//     the keyboard follows the newest ARRIVAL, and a redial in the background
//     must not steal it from a machine the person has actually walked to.
//
// AND IT MAKES THE OTHER WINDOWS WINDOWS. [Turn] tells every surface that did
// NOT start a turn that one has started, because a surface only draws a stream
// it knows about: the events have fanned out to the whole room since version 2
// and a watching window had nowhere to put them, so it sat on a still frame
// while the work went on in front of somebody else.
//
// AND INTENT GOES UP, FACTS COME DOWN. Versions 1 to 3 made every fact a
// QUESTION: a surface drew a status line by asking the engine what the model
// was, what had been spent, what the conversation weighed and how hard it was
// being asked to think — four round trips over an ssh pipe, on a frame the
// person expected to be instant. Version 4 turns that around. The engine states
// those facts, unasked, whenever they move; the surface keeps a replica and
// reads it from memory. What still travels UP is intent — a message, a key, an
// answer — because intent is the one thing the far end cannot know on its own.
//
// The delta is two additions and no removals:
//
//   - [FactsPush] is the whole fact set with a revision number, and
//     [Welcome.Facts] is the one a surface arrives holding.
//   - the "facts" frame carries later ones. It belongs to the CONNECTION and
//     not to a stream, so a fact that moves between turns still lands.
//
// Both are additive and omitempty, exactly as version 2's were, and the door
// still refuses a mismatch: a version-3 engine states nothing, so a version-4
// surface reading a replica off it would draw a status line frozen at whatever
// the welcome said.
//
// VERSION 4 ADDS [MethodPing]. It changes no session state and carries no
// payload in either direction; the version still moves because a method one
// half may send and the other half cannot answer is a protocol difference, and
// Decision 3 in docs/REMOTE.md says those differences are refused at the door.
//
// VERSION 5 ADDS [MethodPlacesTask]. Version 4 moved the PLACES onto
// the machine that owns the work ([MethodPlacesWorld]), and the tasks place duly
// listed the far machine's four hundred pieces of work — but the CARD behind one
// of those rows still read the last thing that work said off THIS process's
// disk, at a path that only exists on the other one. The door that ends it is
// one. The method also carries the bounded journal tail a hosted task room
// needs, so both halves must agree on its meaning at the version door.
//
// AND THE OTHER PLACES METHODS RIDE THE SAME NUMBER. Places.Task moved the door once; the
// ledger, search, memory and archive methods in wire_places.go stay on that
// same version because an older engine's no-such-method answer has an explicit
// honest fallback on the surface.
//
// VERSION 6 IS TWO LANES' ONE BUMP, the same way version 4 was: steering and
// the task door landed together and a number that moved twice for one release
// would refuse engines for no reason.
//
// It adds [MethodSteer]. A local surface could put words into a running turn,
// but the client agent did not expose that verb and a hosted surface therefore
// hid the key entirely. Steering is another stream-opening intent: the returned
// stream is the running turn from the correction onward, exactly as
// [session.Agent.Steer] defines it.
//
// And it adds THE TASK DOOR — [MethodTaskStart], [MethodPlannerStart] and
// `Task.Judge`, which version 16 retired (wire_task.go). Every place method before it was a READING,
// which is why they could ride version 5 behind an honest fallback: an engine
// that cannot answer one leaves a page drawing the sentence it has always
// drawn. These calls are not reading. They COMMISSION WORK on the far machine
// and spend that machine's money doing it, so there is no sentence a surface
// could draw instead of an answer — either the far end starts the task or
// nothing happened. A surface that sent [MethodTaskStart] to an engine which
// does not know the method would have told a person their work was under way
// while the far machine refused a name it had never heard, and that is
// precisely the guess Decision 3 refuses to let two builds make three turns
// into a conversation. So the number moves and the mismatch is refused at the
// door, in the same sentence naming the same fix.
//
// VERSION 7 opens a running task's room by id and carries its steer and stop
// verbs. A running node has no record URI yet, so version 5's Places.Task door
// cannot name it; the node id belongs to the current engine conversation and
// exists from admission onward. The room read is bounded and the two writes
// preserve the session agent's own answers.
//
// VERSION 8 PUSHES THE TASK LANE, and it is the last half of version 6's task
// door. Version 6 let a hosted surface COMMISSION work on the far machine and
// left it with no way to watch what it had commissioned: a node's life — queued,
// running, done — is emitted on the session's STANDING task subscription, which
// no frame carried, so `/task solo …` over a connection answered "started", ran
// to completion on the far machine, and never put a row on the rail of the person
// who typed it. A model's proposal looked like it worked only because a proposal
// happens inside a turn and the turn's stream carried its updates by accident of
// where it was raised.
//
// The delta is one intent up and one fact down, on the shape version 4 named:
//
//   - [MethodTaskWatch] is the surface saying it draws tasks. The engine opens
//     one standing subscription per surface that asks, which REPLAYS THE WHOLE
//     ROSTER before its first live event (session's [Agent.WatchTaskUpdates]),
//     so a window that attached an hour into the work still learns every row.
//   - the "task" frame carries each of that lane's events onward. It belongs to
//     the CONNECTION and not to a stream, exactly as "facts" does, because a
//     node's landing happens when no turn is running and there is no stream left
//     for it to land on.
//   - [MethodTaskPending] answers the one question the lane cannot: which
//     proposals are still open. It is asked only while a card is on screen and a
//     turn has just ended, never on a frame and never on a pointer.
//   - [MethodTaskResolve] carries the answer to a proposal, and it is the door
//     whose absence broke everything else. The surface asserts the task seam as
//     ONE interface — the lane, the pending reading, and this — so a wire holding
//     three of the four left a hosted rail unsubscribed rather than partly
//     working, with nothing on any screen saying why. internal/tui3's DrawsTasks
//     is that assertion made checkable, and cmd/codeaf makes it.
//
// The number moves rather than riding version 7 for [MethodTaskStart]'s reason:
// an engine that does not know Task.Watch would answer the surface's one
// subscription with "no such method" and leave the rail permanently empty with
// nothing on the screen saying so.
//
// VERSION 9 CARRIES THE FOREGROUND-COMMAND CLOCK IN [Welcome]. The clock is
// armed from the engine machine's profile, while a hosted surface has a
// different profile of its own. Leaving the field out would make the row draw
// a deadline no process on the far machine was following. The number moves
// because an older same-version engine would otherwise be accepted and answer
// the new field with zero, which is itself a real and different posture.
//
// VERSION 10 CARRIES [MethodTaskHold]. A version-9 engine would reject the
// first rune's hold while its surface already showed "waiting on you", then
// admit the task on the deadline the person believed had stopped.
//
// VERSION 11 CARRIES THE HARNESS LANE. A design card and a subharness intake
// card are raised on a subscription that outlives the turn (internal/session's
// emitHarness), and only a running turn's stream crossed this wire — so
// cmd/codeaf built every hosted session with the designer nilled and the cards
// off, and said so in prose. The delta is one subscription up
// ([MethodDesignWatch]), its frames down ("design"), and the intake card's
// answer ([MethodSubharnessResolve]); the design card's own answer has been
// [MethodHarness] since version 1. A lane without its answer door puts a
// question on a screen that nothing can close, which is the fault version 8
// found in the task rail.
//
// The adaptive run lane is deliberately NOT part of this delta; lanes.go states
// exactly what is missing from it.
//
// The number moves rather than riding version 10 for [MethodTaskWatch]'s
// reason: an older engine answers the new subscription with "no such method"
// and leaves a lane permanently dark with nothing on the screen saying so.
//
// VERSION 12 CARRIES [Hello.Join] AND [Hello.Watch], AND THE NUMBER IS THE
// ENFORCEMENT. Both are SAFETY fields — one says "never start a conversation",
// the other says "never give me the keyboard" — and both are omitempty booleans,
// which is exactly the shape a version-11 engine DISCARDS in silence. That
// engine would then do the two things the fields exist to prevent, before the
// surface ever sees a welcome to check: boot a whole conversation to answer a
// question about work that is running, and hand a reader the keyboard off the
// window that owns the work. Neither is recoverable by a check afterwards.
//
// So the guarantee is the door's, not the flag's. The version is compared before
// [AttachOptions.Open] is called and before [Session.attach] runs, by BOTH
// builds — and a version-11 engine enforces it against a version-12 surface
// using code that has been there since version 1. That is the only mechanism in
// this protocol an old peer can be trusted to run.
//
// VERSION 13 IS THE MOVE, AND IT IS A RULING ABOUT WHAT A SECOND WINDOW MEANS.
// Versions 4 to 12 let several surfaces sit in one conversation and arbitrated
// between them with a keyboard ([Driver]): the newest arrival typed, the others
// watched. The ruling is that a person opening a conversation in the terminal
// they are standing at MEANS TO BE IN IT, and the window they walked away from
// should say so and step back — one conversation, one window, and the way back
// is the same keystroke from the other side.
//
// The delta is one frame down, and nothing goes up:
//
//   - the "moved" frame carries a [Moved] to every OTHER surface in the room
//     when a window arrives that is neither a watcher ([Hello.Watch]) nor a
//     link coming back ([Hello.Back]). The surface hearing it DETACHES — the
//     engine holds the conversation and the work never stops — and lands on
//     home with that row under the cursor.
//
// THE NUMBER MOVES BECAUSE THE OLD BEHAVIOUR WAS A BEHAVIOUR AND NOT A GAP. A
// version-12 surface joined by a version-13 one never hears the frame and stays
// attached, watching, exactly as it did before — which is not broken, and is
// precisely why an engine may not be left to guess: a version-12 ENGINE would
// leave two windows both believing they are the one in the conversation, and
// only the door can tell those two builds apart.
// VERSION 14 CARRIES THE QUESTIONS LANE, and it is the last of the standing
// lanes to cross. A question is one decision handed to a person with its
// evidence attached (docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md), and internal/session
// speaks every one of them on a subscription of its own that outlives the turn
// — [session.Agent.WatchQuestions], which replays everything still open the
// moment a surface attaches. That subscription had no frame here, so a hosted
// surface asserted the questions half of its agent, found no
// [Agent.WatchQuestions] on it, and drew nothing: an `ask` on the road a plain
// `codeaf` takes stopped the turn with no block, no chip and no row on any
// screen, for as long as the person left it. Measured at three minutes.
//
// The delta is one intent up and one fact down, on the shape versions 8 and 11
// named:
//
//   - [MethodQuestionWatch] is the surface saying it draws questions. The
//     engine opens one subscription per surface that asks, which REPLAYS WHAT
//     IS STILL OPEN before its first live event, so a window that attached an
//     hour into the wait still learns the question.
//   - the "question" frame carries each of that lane's events onward —
//     [session.EventQuestion], [session.EventQuestionWithdrawn] and
//     [session.EventQuestionAnswered], each with the whole object on it. It
//     belongs to the CONNECTION and not to a stream, because most questions
//     outlive the turn that raised them and many never had one.
//
// THE ANSWER'S OWN DOOR WAS ALREADY HERE and is unchanged:
// [MethodQuestionResolve] has carried [session.Answer] whole since it landed.
// That is what made the gap so quiet — the half a person presses worked
// perfectly and the half that puts the question on the screen did not exist.
//
// The number moves rather than riding version 13 for [MethodTaskWatch]'s
// reason, and the reason is the whole of the discipline here: a version-13
// engine answers this subscription with "no such method" and leaves the lane
// permanently dark, with nothing on the screen saying why. Refused at the door,
// a person is told their engine is an older codeaf; accepted, they would be told
// nothing at all and their turn would simply stop. NEVER TO SILENCE.
// VERSION 15 IS AN ANSWER THAT IS A MESSAGE (docs/design/questions/DESIGN.md).
// A question the model asks no longer exists only for as long as the call that
// asked is parked on it: the answer is delivered to the conversation, which is
// what lets the model carry on while somebody decides, lets a clock take the
// pick on a question nobody is waiting on, and lets a decision be CHANGED
// afterwards. Two of those cross this wire:
//
//   - [session.Answer.Revises] says an answer is a person changing their mind
//     about a settled question rather than a second click on one somebody else
//     has already answered. It rides [MethodQuestionResolve], which has always
//     carried the answer whole.
//   - [MethodQuestionHold] stops a question's clock without answering it.
//
// THE NUMBER MOVES BECAUSE BOTH FAIL AS SILENCE ON AN OLDER ENGINE. A version-14
// engine reads `revises` as a field it does not know, applies answers.go's own
// law — a late answer is ignored and nothing says so — and the person watches
// their change do nothing; and it answers `Question.Hold` with no such method
// while its clock goes on counting, so the pick is taken under the hand of
// somebody who pressed a key to stop exactly that. NEVER TO SILENCE.
//
// AND VERSION 15 CARRIES THE READ SIDE OF THE QUESTION RULES, which is the other
// half of the same number and travelled with it rather than moving it again.
// [MethodSetAutonomy] crossed alone: this wire could WRITE a project's rules and
// never read them
// back. That was not a remote-only fault — the ordinary launch talks to its own
// engine through this client — so `/autonomy` and the settings rows beside it
// answered `this conversation has no project to keep question rules in` on every
// machine, whatever project it was in, because the door they asserted did not
// exist. [MethodAutonomy] is the missing half and carries
// `map[session.AskKind]session.Policy` down.
//
// AND THE NUMBER MOVES FOR THE SAME REASON VERSION 14'S DID, which is why this
// could not ride 14. A version-14 engine answers this call with "no such method"
// and the client can only report that it could not read the rules; ridden
// silently, an empty answer is INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A PROJECT THAT KEEPS NO
// RULES, and every row on the settings page would say `ask me` while the engine
// was quietly on `decide`. A wrong account of what may happen without a person
// is the one thing this lane must never give, so the refusal is at the door and
// the nil that comes back is drawn as "not read" rather than as "nothing set"
// (client.Autonomy, and settingsautonomy.go's own reading).
//
// VERSION 16 IS THE TASK DOOR THAT STOPPED WAITING (issue #936). `/task` used to
// be two calls in series — `Task.Judge`, then [MethodTaskStart] held open for
// the engine's shaper — and the engine now admits the work at once and reads its
// width and writes its brief beside the worker. So `Task.Judge` is gone,
// [TaskStartArgs] carries the one fact the engine cannot know (`solo`), and the
// start is an ordinary call with the ordinary deadline. The number moves because
// a version-15 engine would still hold the start behind its shaper for up to
// half a minute while this surface had stopped waiting at ten seconds: the
// person would be told their work did not start while it did. NEVER TO A
// SENTENCE THAT IS FALSE.
const Version = 16

// AND THE NEWS FRAMES RIDE THAT SAME NUMBER, for the reason the places methods
// rode version 5's: neither half can be surprised by them. "phase" and "lane"
// are pushes the surface never asks for, and a version-13 surface that does not
// know either kind IGNORES it (client.go's reader, and the law stated on
// [Frame.Kind]); a version-13 engine that does not send them leaves a surface
// drawing exactly what it drew before, which is nothing. There is no state on
// either side that a missing frame can leave wrong, so there is nothing for a
// door to refuse — and refusing an engine over a status line would be this
// protocol turning a live conversation away for a decoration.
//
// [MethodAnswerLaneOffer] rides it too, and that one is a METHOD, which
// Decision 3 in docs/REMOTE.md normally refuses across a version. It is the
// documented exception: an older engine answers "no such method", the surface
// reads that as false, and false is a REAL ANSWER on this door rather than a
// failure — the lane came good, or the request ended, or the offer aged out
// ([provider.AnswerOffer] says so). A person on an old engine presses `y` and
// nothing happens, which is exactly what happened before the door existed.

// Frame is one line on the wire, either direction.

	// project, every conversation in it, and the work each of those ran

	//
	// AND IT IS NOT [MethodFetchFile]. That door answers under the two-roots law
	// — this conversation's workspace and this conversation's own folder — and a
	// task's journal is in ANOTHER conversation's folder under the state root, so

	// MethodDetach is a surface LEAVING ON PURPOSE, and it is the one method

	//
	// Version 1 had no way to say this, so a closed window and a dead pipe were
	// the same event and the engine had to treat both as an interrupt. That was
	// the right reading of a closed window and the wrong reading of a dropped
	// connection, and the person could not tell the two apart either — they
	// closed a laptop lid and lost a running turn.
	//
	// Version 2 splits them. Detach says "this surface is going; the turn is
	// yours to finish", and the engine keeps working, keeps the events, and
	// holds any question it raises ([HeldQuestion]). A pipe that simply dies
	// means the same thing — the engine assumes the surface will be back — and
	// the deliberate END of a conversation is what [MethodClose] has always
	// been. So the three roads out finally read as three different things.
	MethodDetach = "Detach" // nothing → nothing

	// MethodFetchFile is the reverse of an attachment: the surface asking for

	//
	// IT IS WHAT MAKES `/export` AND A DOWNLOADED DELIVERABLE HONEST. Version 1
	// had no door for moving a byte from the engine machine to the surface's,
	// so /export assembled what the surface happened to be holding and said
	// `· on this machine`, and a file the session MADE could not be brought
	// here at all. The path is never resolved on this side — it is the engine's
	// path, the way every path on a "result" already is.
	MethodFetchFile = "Fetch.File" // FetchFileArgs → FetchedFile

	// MethodHeldQuestions is what a surface asks the moment it attaches: the
	// questions this session raised while nobody was looking. See
	// [HeldQuestion] for why they wait rather than expire.
	MethodHeldQuestions = "Held.Questions" // nothing → []HeldQuestion

	// MethodListDir is one directory of the engine's, as a listing rather than
	// as bytes: what the browse view and the surface's file picker over a

	// [MethodFetchFile] (file.go's handOver): the workspace and the session's
	// own folder, and nothing outside them crosses.
	MethodListDir = "List.Dir" // ListDirArgs → DirListing

	// MethodStatPaths is the honesty rule of tui3's pathlink.go carried over
	// the wire: nothing on a hosted session becomes a link until the ENGINE
	// says the path exists, because a stat is a fact about the other machine.
	// It is batched — one call per burst of new rows, never one per word.
	MethodStatPaths = "Stat.Paths" // StatPathsArgs → []PathFact

	// MethodDepositFile is [MethodFetchFile] walked backwards: a file going
	// from the surface's machine to the engine's, and NOT AS A MESSAGE.
	//
	// IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE BROWSE PAGE HAS A DRAG-DROP LANE AND THE WIRE HAD
	// NOWHERE TO PUT WHAT LANDED ON IT. [MethodSubmitFiles] already writes a
	// person's files into a session's attachments, but it is a MESSAGE: the
	// engine keeps the bytes and then opens a turn on them. A file dropped on
	// a web page is not a sentence anybody said, so submitting it would start a
	// turn nobody at this end asked for, spend somebody's money on it, and
	// stream its answer into a channel that page is not reading.
	//
	// SO THIS METHOD KEEPS AND DOES NOTHING ELSE. The bytes land in the far
	// session's attachments/ folder — the same place [SubmitFilesArgs]'s files
	// land, under the same name law, and NOWHERE ELSE; an arbitrary path on the
	// engine's disk is not a thing this wire will ever write to. No turn opens,
	// no event is sent, nothing reaches the transcript: a deposit is a FACT ON
	// DISK, and the conversation learns of it only when a person mentions it.
	// The lane for a person's own message with a file on it is still /attach.
