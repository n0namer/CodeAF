// ── THE SURFACE HALF ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This file is everything the local half of `codeaf chat --host devbox` needs:
// a [Client] over the ssh process's pipes, and an [Agent] that satisfies
// internal/tui3's own Agent interface so the surface cannot tell the difference.
// The surface calls methods; this turns them into lines; the engine answers.
//
// THREE GOROUTINES AND NO MORE. One writer, serialized by a mutex, because two
// halves of two frames interleaved on one pipe is a stream nobody can decode.
// One reader, which is the ONLY thing that touches the routing maps — and, on a
// client that roams (redial.go), the thing that opens the next pipe as well: a
// reader whose link has died has nothing to read, so it is exactly the goroutine
// that should be redialling. And one pump per open stream, which exists for the
// reason stated on [stream]: the reader must never be the thing that blocks.
//
// EVERY EVENT IS DELIVERED EXACTLY ONCE, and that is the whole correctness
// argument for replay. A returning surface tells the engine how far it got
// ([Hello.Resume]) and the engine sends what came after, but the boundary is
// agreed by two machines over a link that just failed, so the surface must be
// able to survive being sent a little of what it already has. So every stream
// remembers the highest [Frame.Seq] it has actually HANDED TO THE SURFACE, and
// an event whose seq is at or below that is DROPPED rather than delivered —
// because the alternative is a turn's text drawn twice on the screen, which is
// the one failure a person would read as the program having lost its mind.
//
// SEQ ZERO IS NOT A DUPLICATE. Numbering starts at 1 (wire.go says so), so a
// zero means this engine does not number its events at all; those are always
// delivered and never move the cursor. A client must not go quiet because the
// far end declined to count.
//
// EVERY CALL HAS ONE DEADLINE, AND IT IS SHORT BECAUSE OF WHERE IT IS ASKED
// FROM. The surface asks these from its update loop — Model, Usage,
// ContextTokens, Title, and a person's keystroke on a question too — and an
// update loop that blocks is a terminal that has stopped repainting. That is
// true of an act as much as of a getter, which is why an act does not get a
// longer window than a getter and why callclass.go states the measurement that
// settled it. A pipe whose far end died without closing (a laptop that slept, a
// network that went away) would hang there forever, so a call that has waited
// [callDeadline] gives up.
//
// AND GIVING UP IS NOT THE CONNECTION DYING, WHICH IS THE HALF THIS FILE USED
// TO GET WRONG. A deadline that ran out answered with [Client.gone] — "the
// connection to <machine> is gone — run the same command to pick the
// conversation back up" — about a link that was carrying that turn's events at
// that very moment. It buried nothing (only the reader ever calls [Client.bury],
// on a pipe that actually failed), so the sentence was the whole of the damage,
// and it was enough: the surface believed it, and the person read that their
// keystroke had missed an engine that had already applied it. A timeout now says
// [lateCallTail] instead, and [Client.gone] is kept for a pipe that broke.
//
// NO GETTER MEASURES ANYTHING EXTRA. Every getter is one frame out and one
// frame back. [Client.Ping] is the explicit exception: one empty call on the
// surface's five-second clock, never a second call hidden behind a getter. The
// surface asks Model() on frames it repaints, so a measurement there would have
// doubled the cost of drawing a status line.

// callDeadline is how long any one call waits for its result. See the law above.
const callDeadline = 10 * time.Second

// Client is one connection to one engine. It is safe for concurrent use, which
// it has to be: the surface asks synchronous getters from its update loop while
// a turn's events are arriving on the reader.

// [Client.write] holds the writer's lock across a `Write` and a flush, and over
