// ── THE LAW: A DOOR THE ENGINE HAS EITHER CROSSES THE WIRE OR IS WRITTEN DOWN ─
//
// internal/tui3 reaches for almost everything through an OPTIONAL interface —
// `a.agent.(typingAgent)`, `a.agent.(memoryAgent)` — and that is the right
// shape: a capability with nothing behind it must be ABSENT rather than present
// and failing (the design law in CLAUDE.md). What it cannot do is tell you when
// the thing behind it went missing, because a failed assertion looks exactly
// like a capability that was never meant to be there.
//
// AND THE DEFAULT ROAD IS THE REMOTE ONE. A bare `codeaf` holds a
// `*remote.Agent` talking to a detached engine — `v3TakeHostRoad` in
// cmd/codeaf/chatv3_local.go is true for every launch but `--no-host`,
// `--debug`, first-run setup and a hostless `--once`. So a door that
// `*session.Agent` has and `*remote.Agent` does not is a feature that works in
// every test and in nobody's terminal. [MethodTyping] was one: the probe that
// exists so a think-pause does not cost a TLS handshake was wired to a keystroke
// the default road could not deliver, and the whole mechanism was dead where
// people actually run.
//
// SO THE GAPS ARE A LEDGER AND THE LEDGER ONLY SHRINKS. Every door the local
// engine has and the wire does not must be named below with the reason it has
// not crossed yet; a door that DOES cross must be deleted from the list; and
// the count is ratcheted, so the next gap cannot be added silently. This is the
// known-red discipline (internal/ci), applied to the one asymmetry that has
// twice shipped a feature nobody could reach.

// absentDoor is one door the wire does not carry, and WHAT A PERSON MEETS
// BECAUSE OF IT — which is the half the first version of this ledger left out
// and the half that decides which of these gets fixed first.
//
// A capability that cannot work is ABSENT, NOT BROKEN (CLAUDE.md's design law),
// and about half of these obey it: the page, the section or the count is simply
// not drawn, and a person meets nothing. The other half do the inverse. The
// surface's `a.hosted()` guard is `a.host != ""` and is set only on the
// `--host <dest>` road, so on a BARE `codeaf` — the default launch, and the one
// that holds a `*remote.Agent` — every one of those guards is skipped, the local
// branch runs, and the person is told a reason that is not the reason. `/remember`
// says memory is switched off. `/land` says nothing is waiting. `/autonomy` says
// the conversation has no project. All three are false, and all three send a
// person to a settings page that will not help them.
type absentDoor struct {
	// says is the sentence a person meets, quoted as the code spells it, and
	// EMPTY WHERE THE DOOR IS SILENTLY ABSENT. Empty is the law being obeyed;
	// a sentence is the law being inverted, and those are the ones to land

//
// THEY ARE A FINDING AND NOT A DESIGN. Nothing on this list was decided to be
// local-only; each is a door somebody wired to `*session.Agent` and nobody
// carried across. Writing them down is what turns a silence into a number
