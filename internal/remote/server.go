package remote

// server.go is the ENGINE half: the side that holds a real conversation and
// answers frames about it. It is what `codeaf engine` runs after it has changed
// into the workspace and assembled an agent exactly the way `codeaf chat` does.
//
// The shape is one reader, one writer, and one ORDERED LANE, and everything
// else follows from it. Calls that open a stream or change the conversation's
// shape still arrive and are answered in the order the surface made them — on
// the lane, which is one goroutine that is not this one ([classify] is the one
// predicate, orderedlane.go is the mechanism). A surface that sets a model and
// then submits a message means those two things in that order and nothing here
// may reorder them. The one exception is a turn's events, which arrive on a
// channel the session owns and are pumped by a goroutine of their own — that
// is the whole reason Submit answers with a stream id instead of a transcript.
//
// NOTHING AT ALL RUNS ON THE READER. A listing that held it used to queue a
// person's keystroke behind it until [callDeadline] fired and the surface
// declared the connection gone, while the engine went on to apply the key; a
// SEND held it for the whole of the engine's preamble and did the same thing to
// every frame behind it. Both are the same defect — a person's act queued
// behind work that had nothing to do with it — and the reader now does the one
// job its name claims.
//
// ORDER IS WORTH MORE THAN OVERLAP for the calls on the lane, and the one that
// pays for it is Compact: it is the only method that does the work itself
// rather than starting it, so a compaction pass holds the lane for as long as
// the summarizer takes and the ordered calls behind it wait. Handing Compact a
// goroutine would buy nothing the reader does not already give — the status
// line stays live because the socket stays read — and would cost the guarantee
// that a /model followed by a message is a message on the new model.
//
// ── VERSION 2: THE CONVERSATION IS NOT THE CONNECTION ────────────────────────
//
// Version 1 had one object doing two jobs, because a pipe and a conversation
// had the same lifetime: the thing that read frames also owned the agent, and
// when the pipe died the agent died with it. Version 2 splits them in two,
// which is the whole of this file's new shape:
//
//   - [Session] is the CONVERSATION. It owns the agent, the stream counter, the
//     ring of a running turn's events, the questions raised with nobody
//     watching, and the set of surfaces currently attached. It outlives any one
//     connection when somebody is holding it (internal/enginehost) and is
//     closed with the connection when nobody is (a bare `codeaf engine`).
//   - [server] is one CONNECTION. It reads frames, writes frames, and holds a
//     pointer to the session it attached to. Several of them can point at one
//     session, which is what makes a desk and a phone one room.
//
// The three roads out of a connection are finally three different things, and
// the fork is stated once, at the bottom of [server.serve]: a DETACH keeps the
// conversation, a TORN PIPE keeps it when the engine is persistent and ends it
// when the engine is the conversation's whole life, and a CLOSE ends it always.
