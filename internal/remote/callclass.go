// ── THE ROAD IS CLASSED, NOT FREE-FOR-ALL ───────────────────────────────────
//
// callClass is WHAT A METHOD OWES THE ONES AROUND IT, and it is THE ONE
// PREDICATE that decides where the method runs: [server.serve] asks it and
// nothing else in this package asks that question anywhere else. A list
// sprinkled through the switch in [server.invoke] would be a second answer
// waiting to disagree with this one, and one method in the wrong place there is
// a keystroke queued behind a getter — which is what this file was written for.
//
// ORDERED is anything that opens a stream or changes the conversation's shape.
// What it owes is an ORDER, twice over: a stream's first event may not overtake
// the result that names it ([server.release] is one slot for that reason), and
// a surface that sets a model and then submits means those two things in that
// order (server.go's file header).
//
// A GETTER is a read. The surface asks half of them from its update loop, so
// they may not queue behind anything (a listing that blocked a keystroke was
// the measured defect) and they may not wait longer than [callDeadline] (a
// terminal that has stopped repainting).
//
// AN ACT is a person's small write — answering a card, taking the keyboard,
// interrupting, saying they have started typing. It owes nothing to anything
// for the getter's reason said the other way round: a key is not queued behind
// a listing. It waits the same [callDeadline] a getter does, and the note below
// the classes says why the longer window it was given first had to come back
// out.
//
// AND LETTING EITHER OF THEM OVERTAKE AN ORDERED CALL COSTS NOTHING, which is
// the whole licence for this split and is worth stating plainly: EVERY CALL ON
// THIS WIRE IS A SYNCHRONOUS ROUND TRIP ([Client.callAnswered] waits for the
// result frame). A caller that makes two calls therefore has the first one's
// answer in hand before the second frame is written, so two calls whose order
// matters were already ordered by the caller and cannot be reordered here; two
// made from different goroutines were never ordered by anything, before this
// change or after it.
//
// A METHOD THIS FUNCTION HAS NOT HEARD OF IS ORDERED. A door that lands next
// year keeps its place in the queue until someone decides it is a getter or a
// small act, which is the same allow-list shape [watcherMay] uses.
//
// ── AND ORDERED NEVER MEANT "ON THE READER" ─────────────────────────────────
//
// That was the confusion this file carried until 2026-09-11, and it is why a
// keystroke could sit behind a send. Running the ordered bodies on the
// goroutine that reads the socket gave the order for free and took the READING
// away with it: [MethodSubmit] alone rebinds the client, re-reads the person's
// standing orders, reassembles the system prompt, journals the message and
// starts the naming errand before it returns, and for all of that the engine
// was not reading its own pipe. A person who pressed Enter and then Esc was
// queued behind their own send. [MethodCompact] was the extreme case — it does
// the summarizer's work itself — and it was described here as the price of
// being ordered, which it never was.
//
// SO THE READER READS, AND NOTHING ELSE. Every class runs its body off it; what
// a class chooses is WHICH goroutine ([callClass.road]). Ordered calls go to
// the connection's one [orderedLane] — one goroutine, arrival order, which is
// exactly the guarantee the reader was giving and is now given by the thing
// that actually needs it. Getters and small acts owe each other nothing, so
// each takes a goroutine of its own.
//
// AND THE ORDERED LANE IS THE ONLY OWNER OF [server.pending]. Every method that
// names a stream is ordered, so the one slot is written and read by one
// goroutine and needs no lock. A method that opened a stream from any other
// class would be racing it, which is what [TestEveryStreamOpenerIsOrdered]
// refuses.

// road is WHERE a class of call runs, and this is the one place a class is
// turned into a goroutine. [server.serve] switches on it and nothing else
// decides it, so a method's road is a property of its class rather than a
// branch at the site that happens to read the socket.
//
// NEITHER ROAD IS THE READER. That is the law of this file said as a type: the
// goroutine that reads the socket has no third option to be given.

// ── AND AN ACT DOES NOT GET A LONGER WINDOW THAN A GETTER ───────────────────
//
// It is the obvious second half of this fix and it was written, measured and
// TAKEN BACK OUT, so here is the measurement rather than the temptation.
//
// The argument for it is real: a getter that gives up costs one stale number
// and is asked again on the next frame, while an act that gives up costs a
// DECISION — the engine takes the answer and this window is told it did not.
// So an act was given three times [callDeadline], thirty seconds.
//
// WHAT THAT BUYS IS A FROZEN TERMINAL, because an act is asked from the update
// loop exactly as a getter is: internal/tui3's [app.answerQuestion] calls its
// door straight from Update rather than from a command, so the window is also
// the longest that terminal can sit without repainting after a key is pressed.
// Measured on the Spark, eighteen copies of the ordinary road's own e2e run six
// at a time: with thirty seconds, two copies took 53 seconds where every other
// copy took 22, and both lost the receipt — the surface was not drawing. Twelve
// copies of the same commit's parent produced no copy over 33 seconds.
//
// So the window is [callDeadline] for everything, and what stops an act needing
// more is the road above rather than a bigger number: it is no longer queued
// behind anything. A deadline it does reach is now said honestly instead of as a
// dead connection ([Client.late]), and the receipt stamped before the door is
// what makes the engine's news close as yours (internal/tui3's
// [app.markQuestionSent]) — which is the pair that makes a short window safe.

// lateCallTail is what a deadline says on a connection that is still here,
// after [Client.where]. THE CONNECTION IS NOT GONE. The engine may be working
// on this call right now; what ran out is this end's patience. Naming the
// machine the same way [Client.gone] does keeps the two sentences one voice;
// an empty where is "the engine", which is the sentence the surface already
// quotes when a door never answered.
const lateCallTail = " did not answer in time"
