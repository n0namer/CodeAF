// WHERE YOU STAND, YOU WRITE; WHERE YOU REFER, THE WORK IS KEPT AND LANDED.
//
// places.go answers WHICH FOLDERS this conversation is about. This file answers
// what happens when the conversation's own hands — read, write, edit — are
// aimed at one of them.
//
//   - THE STANDING PLACE ([Config.Workspace]) is edited directly, exactly as it
//     always was. Somebody who opened codeaf inside their project loses nothing
//     and notices nothing.
//   - A REFERRED FOLDER gets a working copy of its own, cut LAZILY ON THE FIRST
//     WRITE and never on referring: a repository gets `git worktree add` off its
//     HEAD, a plain folder gets a copy. Every later write to that folder lands
//     in the same copy, and it comes home through the landing the tasks already
//     have — the branch merged ([taskTree.comeHome]), or the files laid back by
//     name ([taskTree.landMirror]).
//
// So the safety story is one sentence: THE ONLY LIVE CHECKOUT THIS CONVERSATION
// CAN CHANGE WITHOUT A LANDING IS THE ONE IT IS STANDING IN. Referring wrongly
// costs nothing, which is what lets the accrual in places.go stay silent: no
// write reaches the person's real folder until they have seen what changed.
//
// ── READS FOLLOW WRITES, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS NOT WRITE-ONLY ──
//
// A model that writes /repo/x and then reads /repo/x MUST see its own work, or
// it is reasoning about a file that no longer says what it thinks. So once a
// folder has a working copy, a READ of a path that EXISTS IN THAT COPY is
// answered from the copy — the copy is that folder's truth for this
// conversation until it lands — and every other read is the real path,
// untouched. That shape was chosen over the two alternatives on purpose:
//
//   - Redirecting no reads would hand the model back the pre-edit bytes of its
//     own file, which is worse than not staging at all.
//   - Redirecting EVERY read under the folder would answer "no such file" for
//     everything a `git worktree` does not carry — an untracked file, a `.env`,
//     the person's uncommitted work — for a conversation that only meant to
//     look. Existence is the honest line between the two.
//
// And a write or an edit to a path that exists in the folder but not yet in the
// copy SEEDS it first ([Agent.seedStandingPath]), so an edit never fails on the
// gap a worktree's HEAD leaves.
//
// ── WHAT IS NOT REDIRECTED, SAID OUT LOUD ──
//
// `bash` is not. A shell command names its paths inside a string this program
// does not parse, and rewriting them would be guessing at somebody's quoting;
// the command runs in the standing workspace and touches whatever it names.
// `grep`, `find` and `ls` are not either: they are questions about what is
// there, and the real folder is the honest answer to those. The manual says
// both of these in the person's own words rather than leaving them to be
// discovered.
//
// ── AND FURROW ──
//
// The design's preference is a furrow universe wherever furrow watches the
// folder: byte-exact, carrying the dirty tree and the environment a worktree
// leaves behind. [internal/furrow] does not offer it yet — its seam materializes
// a universe only as the side effect of RUNNING A COMMAND in one
// ([furrow.Workspace.RunInFork]), and there is no call that simply hands back a
// universe to work in, though the binary's own `furrow fork` can. So the two
// roads below are worktree and copy, and the universe is a named seam: when
// `internal/furrow` grows a Fork door, it belongs in [Agent.cutStandingTree] as
// the first arm, with [furrow.Workspace.MergeFork] as its landing.

//     which is every way a copy comes to hold something. A refusal is not an
//     error here and is not announced: it is the copy being kept.
//   - A PLAIN FOLDER HAS NO GIT TO ASK, so it is compared with the folder it was
