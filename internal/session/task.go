package session

// The task tool: how one piece of work leaves the conversation.
//
// A session is a place to think with somebody, and some work does not want to
// be thought about out loud. A long build-and-fix loop, a mechanical sweep over
// forty files, a rewrite whose only interesting moment is the end — run in the
// conversation, each of those buries the discussion under its own output and
// spends the context window on text nobody will read twice. propose_task is the
// model's way of saying "this part is self-contained; let it go and work
// somewhere else", and the machinery under it (task_run.go) is a GRAPH: the
// proposal is a node, the countdown is how the node is admitted, the worktree is
// how it is isolated, and its report is what its dependents will read.
//
// depends_on exists on the wire and is honoured by the executor, so a
// conversation that grooms two pieces of work can say which waits for which.
//
// ── AND IT IS THE ROAD FOR WIDE WORK, WHICH IT DID NOT USED TO BE ──
//
// "Self-contained" once meant "not wide": a goal with several parts was the
// planner's, and the model reached for run_adaptive the moment somebody asked
// for a broad sweep (tools_harness.go). The division road took that away. A
// wide ask is ONE task now, admitted with the road armed, and the worker hands
// the parts out from the material rather than anybody guessing them from the
// request (task_divide.go). `wide` is how the model says so, and it is the
// model's half of the flip the typed `/task` front door already made.
//
// THE FLIP FINISHED: run_adaptive is off the belt outright, so this is not the
// wider of two hands the model chooses between — it is the ONLY hand the model
// has for work with parts in it. No chat door opens a planned graph at all any
// more (loop.go says where the last one stood); width is always this hand.
//
// ── AND A TASK MAY HAND PART OF ITS OWN WORK OUT ──
//
// This tool is on a NODE'S belt too, and the node's proposals join the
// conversation's own graph under the node that made them (session.go's
// Config.tasker). That is the fan-out law: a step with genuinely INDEPENDENT
// parts is faster as one node per part, each in its own worktree, than as one
// model doing them in order, because the whole then costs the longest part
// rather than their sum however many parts there are. The coordination —
// reading the reports, folding them into one deliverable — stays with the node
// that split the work.
// Work that is sequential, or that shares heavy context, is not split at all:
// the parts would each pay for a worktree, an audit and a wait to save nothing.
//
// TWO BOUNDS, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THING. The DEPTH cap is absence:
// a node standing on taskDepthLimit is handed no propose_task at all, because a
// capability that cannot work is left off the belt rather than made to refuse
// (tools.go). The FAN cap is a REFUSAL the model reads and acts on
// ([TaskGraph.claimChild]) — it has already been given its slots, and the answer
// to a part past them is to do it in its own hands. Why the two numbers are
// what they are is written beside them (task_run.go).
//
// ── THE PROPOSAL IS THE CONSENT, AND IT HAS A CLOCK ──
//
// The call BLOCKS, exactly as a consent question does (consent.go), and it is
// resolved by one of four things: the person approves, the person redirects
// (approval plus a correction appended to the brief), the person declines (the
// model reads the refusal as grooming feedback and keeps working), or THE CLOCK
// APPROVES. Silence is a yes, because the countdown is a window to redirect
// work the model has already groomed rather than a gate the work waits behind:
// a person who is reading, or away, or on another screen must not be the reason
// nothing happened. A surface that draws no answer box for this event is a
// surface where every task starts after fifteen seconds, which is the right
// behavior for a surface that has not been taught the question yet.
//
// ── WHY A HEADLESS RUN NEVER WAITS ──
//
// With nobody subscribed to the events there is no one to answer, so the
// deadline approves whatever the setting says — including the 0 that means
// "wait for an answer" in a watched session. The alternative is a --once run
// that hangs forever on a question with no reader, which is the same fault
// consent.go refuses for the same reason.

// taskDescription is what the model reads before it calls. THE FAN CAP IS
// INTERPOLATED for taskSchemaJSON's reason: a number a model reasons with must
// be the number the code enforces, and the two drift the moment they are typed
// twice.
//
// AND IT IS WRITTEN FOR DENSITY, WHICH IS NOT HOW THIS CODEBASE WRITES PROSE.
// A Go comment is read once by a person and costs nothing; this string is
// marshalled into the tool block that rides in front of EVERY request of every
// turn, so a sentence here is paid some sixty times over one task and its bytes
// crowd out the conversation the model is actually holding. So it says each rule
// once, in an imperative clause, and it says it in the FIELD DESCRIPTION where
// the rule belongs — this preamble is routing guidance and nothing else. It no
// longer teaches the contract in three parts, because brief, deliverable and
// acceptance each teach their own part below and a preamble that said it again
// was the same paragraph billed twice; it no longer explains what makes work
// wide, because the `wide` field is where that is decided; and it no longer says
// the task cannot ask you anything, because that is the reason the brief must be
// self-contained and it is stated there. What is left here is what has no field
// to live in: when to reach for the tool at all, the countdown, the id that
// returns at once, the fan-out a node may make, and the line about files another
// window is already writing. It is short because it is expensive, never because
// a rule was dropped — the rules all still stand, in one place each.
var taskDescription = "Hand self-contained work to a task outside this conversation: work that would flood it or wants a clean context, never work needing back-and-forth. A WIDE CHANGE IS ONE PROPOSAL with `wide`, never several, and do not reach for a planner. The person may redirect or wave it off during a short countdown; silence starts it. The id returns at once; its report starts a turn here when it lands, so never wait or poll. A task may call this for genuinely independent parts of its own work, up to " + strconv.Itoa(taskFanLimit) + " each, with tasks nested at most " + strconv.Itoa(taskDepthLimit) + " deep; sequential or context-sharing parts are faster in your own hands. Files another codeaf window is already writing come back on their own line: nothing is blocked, so plan around them. If you will read the result yourself and carry on, and it does not need its own check or its own branch, use quick_task instead — it starts now and costs nothing to land."

// taskSchemaJSON is the wire schema. depends_on is on it from the first day
// even though a one-node graph can never fill it: the field is the edge, the
// executor already honours it (task_run.go), and a schema that grew the concept
// later would be a second shape for the same idea.
//
// THE TWO THRESHOLD DEFAULTS ARE INTERPOLATED, NEVER TYPED TWICE. They were
// typed twice once, and they drifted: this schema told the model the step
// default was 40 while the executor applied 200 (task_run.go's taskMaxSteps).
// A number in a tool description is not documentation — it is what the model
// reasons with, so a model that wanted room for a long sweep was raising a
// figure that was already five times higher than it believed, and one that
// wanted to keep a small job tight was setting 40 thinking it changed nothing.
// It is a var rather than a const for exactly this reason; the cost is one
// package-level string built at init, and what it buys is a default that
// cannot be wrong.
//
// GROUND AND WHERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS AND TWO FIELDS. `where` is the directory
// the worker types in, which is the person's to name; `ground` is the project
// that directory is a copy OF, which the harness resolves from evidence and the
// model only fills in when it knows better (taskstands.go). They read as one
// question and they are not: the task that made this whole design necessary had
// a perfectly good `where` and was about a repository three levels away from it.
//
// AND TWO RULES LEFT THIS SCHEMA WHEN GROUND ARRIVED, both of them because they
// were being stated twice. "Do not paste or contradict the person's message" is
// prompts/system.md's, where the same line also says the worker follows theirs
// on a disagreement; the class-word rule about `model` came the other way, INTO
// the field that governs it, and left system.md. The prefix is a budget
// (prefixbudget_test.go) and a rule that appears in two places is the cheapest
// thing in it to spend twice.
//
// THE BRIEF AND ACCEPTANCE DESCRIPTIONS CARRY THE SHAPING GUIDE IN MINIATURE.
// prompts/shape.md is the canonical statement of what a worker-ready brief must
// contain, and a person's own /task gets a model call that applies it
// (task_shape.go). A brief the CHAT model writes gets no second call, because
// the chat model has the whole conversation in front of it and a shaper would
// see one sentence — so the guide reaches it here instead, distilled to the
// three moves that survive compression: decide what a worker with nobody to ask
// would have to ask, constrain against the failure THIS kind of work has rather
// than work in general, and make done checkable by somebody else. Anything
// longer belongs in shape.md, and this stays short so the two cannot drift into
// two different accounts of one idea.
//
// AND EVERY FIELD HERE IS WRITTEN FOR DENSITY, for the reason taskDescription
// states about itself: these strings ride in front of every request of every
// turn, so each rule is stated once, in the field it governs, in as few words as
// keep it. The rhetoric is gone and nothing else is.
//
// AND `expects` IS INTERPOLATED, NEVER SPELLED HERE. It is the handoff
// contract's checkable half — what this brief assumes is already true of the
// folder the worker will get, walked before the first model call — and it is
// the SAME text the divider's schema carries, from the one constant that
// spells it (handoffcontract.go). Two doors reading one shape must not come to
// two opinions about it. Its 1,230 bytes were PAID FOR out of prompts/system.md
// rather than taken out of the fixed-prefix budget; the constant's own header
// says what came out and why none of it was a rule stated only there.
//
// AND THE BRIEF IS ALSO WHERE THE DOWRY RIDES. A proposal made from INSIDE an
// answer that has already begun the work holds something no other proposal can:
// what the model has just found out. prompts/system.md teaches the principle —
// the moment you can name the scale in front of you is the moment to hand it
// over, and what you have already learned goes with it — and the brief is where
// it lands, because it is the only part of the contract a finding fits in.
// NOTHING ON THE ROAD CLIPS IT: parseTaskArguments only trims it, [taskSpec]
// carries it whole, and [composeBrief] bounds the person's verbatim ask and
// nothing else — so a findings-rich handoff reaches the worker entire, and this
// sentence is the only thing standing between the model and writing one.
