package session

// The chat's task door on the run engine: a
// `/task` under the bash belt starts a RUN rather than a node of this session's
// own tree. The conversation opens or reuses the store its plan lives in, seeds
// the work from the person's own sentence, hands the store to the run engine in
// a goroutine, and answers AT ONCE with the id the store knows the work by — so
// the person's conversation stays usable while the run goes, and the run's own
// page is the store's root rather than a node this session hosts.
//
// ── WHY THE ENGINE IS A SEAM AND NOT AN IMPORT ──
//
// The run engine ([internal/run]) is built ON this package: its crew factory
// hands every task to [NewBeltWorker] and its landing is [LandRunTree]. A door
// here that imported it would be the cycle the Go compiler refuses, so the
// engine is reached through [RunEngine] — a small interface this package owns,
// implemented by the engine and registered by it ([RegisterRunEngine]) — and a
// build with no engine registered answers the LEGACY road, which is the whole
// of what an unset switch does anyway.
//
// ── OWNERSHIP IS PER PROCESS ──
//
// The running run is held on the Agent ([beltRun]) and nowhere else. A second
// `/task` while one is live adds its work to that same store rather than
// opening a second one, because one store is one run (`plandb`'s own law: a
// store belongs to one root), and the becomes-live child is dispatched by the
// supervisor already turning. A conversation that has no live run seeds a fresh
// store the way [TaskGraph.planSeed] seeds one — adopting a live store it finds,
// archiving a finished one beside the session folder — so a resumed
// conversation keeps reading its own plan.
