// taskplan.go is the run's PLAN as this place draws it: the rows of the store a
// conversation seeded, and the page one of those rows opens.
//
// THE PLAN IS A SECOND READING OF THE SAME WORK, and the two are not copies.
// The record beside a conversation is what sessions WROTE DOWN — a node lands
// and a row survives it. The plan is what a run CARRIES while it is still
// turning: the root task, the children a worker added or split, and the notes
// and steps each of them left, live, in a store the worker's own CLI writes.
// A node the plan dispatches is born FROM a store task, so the two describe one
// piece of work from two ends — and this file is what keeps the place from
// drawing it twice.
//
// IT IS AN OPTIONAL SEAM, like the other-window reading next door: a surface
// driven by a scripted agent has no plan store, and the honest answer for one is
// no rows rather than a door every test has to implement. [planAgent] is the
// slice of [session.Agent] this file needs.
