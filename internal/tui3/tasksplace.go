// THE TASKS PLACE IS ONE READING, AND EVERYTHING ON THE FRAME IS DRAWN FROM IT.
//
// The place answers "what has this machine run" — every project, every
// conversation, this window's own work included. Four authorities know part of
// that answer and no single one of them knows all of it:
//
//   - THE WORLD SCAN knows every project's index file, and it has already
//     settled whether a live-looking row is really still running.
//   - THIS PROJECT'S INDEX, held in memory and merged with this session's live
//     graph, is fresher than the file for the project the window is sitting in.
//   - THIS SESSION'S GRAPH is the only authority for work this window started
//     and has not landed: an ordinary task writes NO row into the project's
//     index until it finishes (internal/session's taskelsewhere.go says why).
//   - THE OTHER WINDOWS on this project are the only authority for THEIR
//     unlanded work, for the same reason.
//
// So the reading takes all four and DEDUPLICATES ON (SessionID, ID) — the pair
// internal/session states is what identifies one row — with the freshest
// authority winning. One piece of work is drawn once, however many of the four
// know about it.
//
// AND WHAT IT DRAWS IS A TREE AND NOT A LIST: the conversation that asked for
// the work, the work, and the work that work asked for, to whatever depth it
// goes ([tasksTreeOf] states the shape and why it is the honest one).
//
// Everything below the reading is pure: it never touches disk and never reads a
// clock. The snapshot is taken when the place opens (and re-grouped, from the
// CACHED world, on a time-window key), so a resize, a cursor move or a frame can
// never walk a directory or find a different `now` halfway through one screen.
