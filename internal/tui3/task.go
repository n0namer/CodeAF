// THE TASK SURFACE: A DECISION, AND THEN A PRESENCE.
//
// internal/session's task_contract.go says what a task IS — a node in a
// dynamically evolving DAG, of which v1 ships the degenerate one-node case —
// and this file is the two places that node touches a person:
//
//   - THE PROPOSAL IS A DECISION MOMENT, INLINE. It arrives mid-conversation,
//     it blocks the turn that raised it, and it is answered once. That is the
//     shape the consent question already has on this surface, so it takes the
//     consent grammar whole: the question hue (violet, the fifth colour, spent
//     nowhere else), the row that keeps its verdict afterwards, the keyboard
//     lane at the bottom of the screen. It is drawn in the TRANSCRIPT rather
//     than above the input because a proposal is part of what happened — the
//     model asked, you answered, the work started — and a modal that vanished
//     would leave the conversation unable to explain where a running node came
//     from.
//   - THE RUNNING NODE IS A STANDING PRESENCE, IN A RAIL. It outlives the turn
//     that proposed it: its "done" lands minutes later with no turn open and no
//     stream to land on. A transcript line cannot hold something that is still
//     true, so the right column holds it — one row per node, alive at the top,
//     gone when it has come home — and the transcript gets one dim line when it
//     lands. THE RAIL IS PRESENCE; THE NOTE IS HISTORY. Neither says the other's
//     half.
//
// THE RAIL IS TREE-READY AND THE TREE IS NOT DRAWN. v1's graph has no edges, so
// nothing here draws one — but every node carries its DependsOn, the row model
// stores it, and a node whose prerequisites are unmet renders v1's own sentence
// under it ("waits: collect sources", internal/tui's model_test.go). When edges
// arrive the shape is already in the model; what changes is how many rows have
// something to say.

// ── the two rows of state ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

// taskCard is one proposal, from the question to the verdict.
//
// It is a pointer held in two places — the transcript entry that draws it and
// [app.task], the lane that answers it — so the answer and the row can never
// disagree about what was decided.

	// It is KEPT AND NEVER UNSET, the way the kind and the branch are: a node that
	// named a context is in that context for the rest of its life, and an update
	// quiet about it has not left the context. A LATER, BETTER NAME REPLACES IT —
	// a design says "designing a subharness" until its page has a name and

	// private round the engine runs on work that came back short, and a person
	// has no use for the existence of that round — what they have a use for is

// a hope.
//
// AND NOBODY FALLS BACK TO THE TOKEN. A word this build has never heard of — an

// ── the roster ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE RAIL WAS A PRESENCE LIST AND IT IS NOW A ROSTER, because the two stop
// being the same thing somewhere around the fortieth node. A presence list holds
// what is alive and forgets everything else, which is exactly right for a
// session with three nodes in it and useless for a day's work: "where did that
// task go" is the commonest question a person asks a column of work, and a
// column that dropped every landed node had already thrown the answer away.
//
// So the column keeps EVERY node the session has admitted, and it survives
// hundreds of them by four mechanisms and no new scroll machinery:
//
//   - IT IS A FOREST AND NOT FIVE BUCKETS. The column used to open with five
//     state headings — needs you, running, idle, parked, done — and file every
//     node under one of them, which scattered ONE run across four sections: the
//     root under `running`, its finished cuts under `done`, the one that
//     conflicted at the top of the column, and nothing on screen saying they
//     were the same piece of work. A shape is the news an adaptive run makes
//     (internal/orchestrate spawns as it learns), and the state of a single node
//     inside it is a detail. So a family is drawn WHOLE, under its own root, in
//     the order the session admitted it — and a node that belongs to no family
//     is the flat row it has always been.
//
//     What the headings sorted, the ORDER of the families still says: a family
//     stands where its most urgent member puts it ([app.railUrgency]), so work
//     that is waiting on a person is at the top of the column and a settled run
//     is at the bottom, whole, one row deep.
//   - FOLDING IS THE PERSON'S, PER FAMILY, AND IT HAS A DEFAULT WORTH HAVING. A
//     family with anything live in it opens; a family that is entirely settled —
//     or entirely waiting — opens as one row wearing the worst thing that
//     happened under it and a count of what it is standing for. The map is the
//     person's correction of that default and it sticks ([app.railShut]).
//   - THE COLUMN IS A WINDOW. What shows is a slice of the line list around the
//     focus, taken by [listTop] — the same function the model picker and the two
//     typed lists scroll with, because a second scroller on this surface would be
//     a second set of off-by-ones.
//   - THE FOOTER SAYS THE WHOLE. What the window cannot show — the spend, the
//     weight, the count of every state the forest has folded into a shape — is
//     one dim block at the bottom of the column, in the group vocabulary the
//     headings used to carry.
//
// THE KEYBOARD IS ASKED FOR, NEVER TAKEN (alt+t, esc to give it back). The

//
// So a closed column leaves an EDGE: [railGripCols] columns down the right of
// the frame, near-silent, with a handle at the middle of it, and the whole strip
// is a door. Pressing anywhere on it is exactly ctrl+g ([app.railStow] takes
// both).
//
// THREE THINGS KEEP IT HONEST:
//
//   - IT COSTS WHAT IT SHOWS. The strip is charged to the conversation through
//     [app.railWidth] like the column it stands for, so the transcript re-wraps
//     two columns narrower and nothing is ever drawn under it.
//   - IT WHISPERS ONLY WHAT IS TRUE. One cell above the handle carries the state
//     of the work while there is work in a state worth carrying — something
//     running, or something waiting on a person — and NOTHING otherwise, which
//     is the emptiness law in the smallest space this surface has.
//   - IT IS NOT THERE WHEN A COLUMN COULD NOT BE. Under [railSlimFloor] the
//     frame lends no columns to anything, and an edge onto a column that cannot
//     stand would be a door onto a room that does not exist.

		//
		// AND THEN IT SAYS WHAT IT IS COSTING, always. The call is what the node is
		// doing this second and it is gone the second after; the telemetry is the
		// standing answer to "is this worth what it is burning", which is the
		// question a person opens this column for and cannot ask anywhere else
		// without leaving the conversation. Between calls the telemetry is the
		// whole of the under-block, which is what the bare clock used to be.
		//
		// AND WHILE THE NODE IS FINISHING OFF, THAT LINE IS THE ONE THAT WINS.
		// A node closing a named gap in work it has otherwise done is the most
		// specific news this column will ever have about it — "adding amp-labs to
		// the report" says both that the end is in sight and what the end is
		// missing — and the call it happens to be inside of while it does that
		// says neither. So it takes the call's row rather than a third one: the
		// block is capped at [railUnderRows] and the telemetry underneath is the
		// standing figure a person is owed at every moment of a run.
		//
		// AND A PACED NODE NEVER CLAIMS A LIVE CALL. While the provider is holding
		// this node's calls back (session's TaskNotice.Waiting) the tool line is
		// the last call, sitting there finished — so the row would be this column
		// asserting a present that is not happening, which is the one thing a row
		// down here may not do. The hold takes that row instead and says what is
		// actually true: the node is running, and it is waiting for its turn on
		// the wire. The telemetry underneath is unchanged, because the clock and
		// the bill go on being the clock and the bill.
		//
		// THE GAP OUTRANKS THE HOLD when a node somehow has both. "adding amp-labs
		// to the report" is news about the WORK and "rate limited" is news about
		// the wire, and of the two the first is the one a person came to this
		// column for; the hold only ever displaces the row that would otherwise be
		// false.
		//
		// AND THE LIFE THE NODE IS IN OUTRANKS THE GAP. A node under a check is
		// not inside a call and has no gap yet, so the rows below would draw a
		// finished call or a clock for four minutes of reading — which is the
		// silence #76 §5 measured. A node inside a repair round has a gap, and
		// [app.railPhase] draws that same gap with what [app.railMending] could
		// not know: that a round is closing it, and which round of how many.
		//
		// AND A NAMED PHASE OUTRANKS ALL FOUR. A node of a kind that names its
		// own moments — a harness being designed, which is "designing" and then
		// "awaiting your look" (session's TaskNotice.Doing) — is saying the most
		// specific true thing there is about it, and the rows below would each

		// AND A NAME IS THE LOUDEST NEWS OF ALL. A notice that carries a title the
		// node does not have was thrown away here, and the row kept the only name
		// this surface can make without one — "task 19" ([taskTitleOf],
		// taskident.go) — for the whole of that node's life, on the column, on the
		// strip, in its room's header and on the card that landed. The states are
		// monotonic but the NAMING is not: a row can be published before its title
		// is known and again after, in the same state, and the second one is the
		// only chance this surface gets to learn what the work is called.
		//
		// AND A LANDING THAT CHANGED WHAT IT IS ASKING IS NEWS IN THE SAME STATE.
		// A node the model accepted whose merge was then REFUSED settles again as
		// `unverified` with a different merge word, a different file list and a
		// different road — a different question, with different answers, now the
		// person's — and a guard that only looked at the state threw that event
		// away, which is why the card in front of somebody kept asking the
		// question the first landing asked ([taskReasks], #767).
		//
		// AND A DECISION CHANGING HANDS IS THE QUIETEST NEWS OF ALL AND THE ONE
		// NOBODY MAY MISS. The floor hands an unanswered question back to the person
		// at the end of the model's turn by publishing a row whose state, span,
		// branch and report are all exactly what they were and whose only news is
		// [session.TaskNotice.Decider] — so a guard that only ever looked at the
