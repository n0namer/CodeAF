// THE TWO BLANK ROWS ARE ONE LADDER, not two decisions: [app.breathingRows] is
// the resting gap this window can afford between the last thing said and the
// box the next thing is typed into — two rows on a tall frame, one on the
// everyday one, none on a short one — and the rows are spent top down, so the
// row a narrow window keeps is the one nearest the draft. The jump chip rides
// the FIRST of them (jumpchip.go), which is why the diagram draws it there.
//
// The status bar used to be the FIRST row, and this wave moved it to the last.
// The reason is where a person's eye already is: on this surface everything
// that changes — the reply arriving, the calls running, the question being
// asked, the sentence being typed — happens at the bottom, and a line about
// what is happening was the one fact parked two feet away from all of it. A
// status line at the bottom is read in the same glance as the box above it,
// which is what makes it worth drawing at all. The footer hints went with it
// (the same line's right end), so the frame lost a whole row of chrome rather
// than moving one.
//
// The rule above the input is the only HORIZONTAL line this surface draws, and
// it draws one thing: where the conversation stops and where the person's own
// business starts. There are still no borders and there are not going to be.
//
// THE RAIL ARRIVED WITH THE TASKER, and it is the frame's one vertical seam:
// thirty columns on the right, drawn only while there is a task to stand in
// them and only on a frame wide enough to lend them (task.go's railFloor). It
// takes its columns from the CONVERSATION and from nothing else — the status
// row and the legend span the whole window, because they are about the window.
//
// THE TWO PINNED ROWS ABOVE IT ARE ABOUT THE WINDOW TOO, so they span it: the
// room's focus header, and the task strip under it. Their combined height is
// [app.topHeight], and it is subtracted from the conversation in the one place
// every geometric question resolves through ([app.viewHeight]).
//
// A FRAME TOO NARROW FOR THE RAIL CAN STILL OPEN THE ROSTER, and there it opens
// over the body instead of beside it (alt+t, task.go's [app.railFull]). The
// strip is what makes that reachable without a key at all.
//
// A terminal too short for all of it gives up its breathing room first — the
// rule and the blank above the draft — and its status line last: what is
// happening and what you are typing are the two facts a one-inch window still
// has to carry.

// inputPad is the one cell the draft block is inset by. It is what makes the
// box read as an object below the rule rather than as one more line of the
// transcript, and it is one cell because two would be a margin.

// at all: the rule, the gap and the pinned header all go, and what is left is
// the conversation, the box and the status line. It is the floor
// [app.headHeight] and the task strip already stood on, written down once.
//
// airyFloor is where a SECOND gap row is affordable. The row costs a row of
// conversation, so it is spent only where there is conversation to spend: at
// sixteen the four resting rows of chrome and both gap rows still leave eleven
// for the transcript, which is a reply's worth. Below it the gap steps back to
// the one row it has always been, so no window that was comfortable yesterday

// THE COMPOSITION IS THE LAST THING THAT HAPPENS TO A FRAME, AND IT IS HERE
// BECAUSE OF ONE RUNE. A conversation named `the café pricing page` is stored
// the way a Mac's own keyboard writes it — `e` followed by U+0301, the combining
// acute — and every layer of ours carries the mark faithfully: [titleCase],
// [fit] and ansi.Truncate all hand it on, and tmux captures it when a shell
// prints it. It is lost BELOW us. bubbletea asks the terminal for mode 2027 at
// startup and only switches its cell buffer to grapheme widths once the terminal
// answers yes; tmux answers no, so the buffer resets the cell it is filling
// before a zero-width rune arrives and the accent lands on a cell of its own,
// where it is either dropped or drawn beside the letter it belongs to. The
// surface then renames somebody's conversation, which is the one thing
// [titleCase] promises never to do.
//
// NFC is the fix at OUR level: `e` + U+0301 becomes the single rune `é`, which
// is one cell whichever width table the buffer is using, and no information is
// lost — NFC is a canonical mapping, so what a person typed and what we draw are
// the same text.
//
// AND IT COSTS NOTHING ON THE FRAMES THAT DO NOT NEED IT, WHICH IS ALL BUT A
// FEW. This runs on every draw and this surface is under an allocation law —
// PERF.md's four-thousand-line scroll ceiling is measured through this very
// function — so what it must not do is build a second copy of the screen sixty
// times a second. [norm.Form.String] is written for exactly that: it spans the
// string for the first byte composition could change and, finding none, HANDS
// BACK THE STRING IT WAS GIVEN, with no allocation at all.
//
// SO THERE IS NO GATE IN FRONT OF IT, and that is a decision and not an
// oversight. Two were tried. [norm.Form.IsNormalString] answers the same
// question and costs one allocation per call whatever it finds — an allocation
// per keystroke to avoid a call that allocates nothing. A hand-rolled walk
// looking for a combining mark allocates nothing and is about twice as quick on
// a frame of this program's own chrome (10µs against 21µs on six kilobytes),
// and it buys that by answering a question norm is the authority on, in a
// second place, for a saving smaller than one entry render.
// [TestComposingAFrameCostsNothingWhenThereIsNothingToCompose] is the law that
// holds the fast path, so a normaliser that rebuilt the frame — [norm.Form.Bytes]
