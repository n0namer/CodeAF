// THE ROOM: A TASK IS A PLACE, AND YOU CAN GO THERE.
//
// task.go says a node touches a person twice — as a decision (the proposal) and
// as a presence (the rail row) — and both of those are things you read ABOUT the
// work. Neither is the work. A node runs for minutes inside a worktree of its
// own, saying things and calling tools the whole time, and until this file the
// only trace of that on screen was a spinner and a clock: a person watching a
// node go the wrong way had exactly one move, which was to kill it and propose
// the corrected task again.
//
// So the rail row is a DOOR. Click it and the body region stops being the
// conversation and becomes that node's own transcript — its history replayed
// from its journal, then its present, live — and the input box below stops
// talking to the model and starts talking to the node. Esc comes back.
//
// ── A ROOM IS A VIEW, NOT A SECOND APP ──
//
// This is the whole reason the file is small. The room does not fork the update
// loop, does not hold a second agent, does not stop the turn: everything under
// it keeps running exactly as it was — the stream keeps streaming into
// [app.entries], the rail keeps ticking, the standing task lane keeps landing
// notes in the conversation — and the ONLY thing that changes is which rows
// [app.bodyRows] hands the frame. Esc restores the conversation exactly, scroll
// position included, because the conversation was never touched: the room keeps
// a scroll offset of its own and never writes the transcript's.
//
// The rail stays on screen for the same reason. The rail is how you leave one
// room for another, so it cannot be a thing you have to come back out to reach.
//
// ── A ROOM IS THE CONVERSATION'S OWN RENDERER, POINTED AT A NODE ──
//
// A room used to draw its own lines: an assistant block was plain text, a tool
// call was one dim line that did not expand, a person's message lost the
// pictures it carried, and reasoning was dropped on the floor. That was a
// SECOND RENDERING of the same four kinds of block, and it diverged the way a
// second rendering always does — not by decision, but one gap at a time, as the
// conversation grew a machine the page had never heard of.
//
// So the page is now built out of the SAME BLOCKS the conversation is made of
// (app.go's [entry]) and drawn by the SAME renderers (render.go's [deck] and
// [app.deckRows]). A node's call expands to its diff, its content, its output;
// its answer renders as markdown when it settles; its reasoning collapses to
// "thought for 6s · ctrl+e"; a person's steered message wears the person's hue.
// Nothing in this file paints a block, because the moment it did there would be
// two answers to "how does a tool call look" again.
//
// What a room still owns is what a room IS: which node, where the reader is in
// it, and the two doors — steering in, esc out.
//
// WITH ONE THING IT DOES DIFFERENTLY, AND IT IS DECLARED RATHER THAN SCATTERED:
// [taskRoom.deck] takes [overseerLens] (lens.go). Out in the thread a finished
// turn's machinery collapses to "▸ worked · 10 tool calls · ctrl+e"; in here
// the same chip is spent per SETTLED PHASE instead of per turn, because a
// node's life is one long turn and folding by turn swallowed the whole page the
// instant it stopped running. Current work uses the conversation's compact
// step display; opening it restores its calls and reasoning. Expanded calls
// retain the room's screenful budget. workfold.go owns settled phase folding,
// while livesteps.go owns the running work's disclosure.
//
// ── THE DOORS ARE ASSERTED, NEVER REQUIRED ──
//
// [taskRoomAgent] is a SECOND interface rather than three more methods on
// task.go's [taskAgent], and the reason is the rail: widening taskAgent would
// mean a session that publishes task updates but has no room doors loses its
// rail as well as its rooms. The two capabilities are asked for separately and
// answered separately, and a surface whose agent cannot answer this one says so
// in a note and stays where it is.

//
// The two are separate doors on purpose (internal/session's task_room.go says
// why): a watcher gets what happens FROM NOW and no history is re-narrated, so
// the history has to come off disk or not at all. A node with no journal path
// opens on its live edge, which is honest — this process never learned which
// file that node wrote.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE JOURNAL AND THEN THE LANE, and it is not arbitrary. The file
// holds every message that has COMPLETED and the lane opens with the step in
// flight ([taskRoomAgent.WatchTask]), so reading first and subscribing second is
// what makes the two meet at one instant instead of overlapping: they are read
// microseconds apart, in the order the node writes them.
// The command that starts the lane is PARKED rather than returned, in
// [app.roomPump]. See that field for the call path that forces it.

// of internal/session's session file — its own line struct, its own scanner, its
// own list of which roles exist, and hand-copied duplicates of two display caps
// that package does not export — and it was the copy that fell behind: it knew
// `user` and `assistant` and nothing else, so a line the session had MARKED came
// back as an ordinary question and yesterday's correction read as a second
// brief.
//
// The reading is internal/session's now ([session.ReadTranscript] and
// [session.ReadTranscriptBytes], which answer the same [session.DisplayEntry]
// shape a live conversation is drawn from), and the shaping is replay.go's one
// walk ([app.replayBlocks], under [roomReplay]). One record, one reading, one
// shaping — so a mark the engine writes cannot be a mark this page fails to
// know about (#252).

// ── the live lane ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// roomEvent folds one of the child's events in and re-arms the pump.
//
// IT IS [app.apply]'s SHAPE, over the page's own reducer: what the event does to
// the transcript is [feed.ingest]'s, once, for every surface, and what it asks
// THIS program loop to do is the switch below. This file used to hold a
// hand-copy of the reducer instead — eleven functions that agreed with the
// conversation's on the day they were written and had fallen behind by six event
// kinds — which is the whole reason the reducer exists (feed.go states the law,
// docs/design/lens/DESIGN.md's Decision 1 states the design).
//
// THE SPEND IS NOT COUNTED HERE, AND THE OMISSION IS THE DESIGN. A node's turn
// totals are folded by its PILOT (task.go's [app.pilotEvent]), which keeps flying
// for as long as the node runs whether or not anybody is standing in its room —
// [app.openRoom] opens a watch of its own beside it rather than taking the
// pilot's over, because internal/session's door is a fan-out (task_room.go:
// openRoom().join()) and hands each caller its own copy of every event. A fold
// on this lane as well would therefore bill every turn twice for exactly as long
// as a person had the page open.
//
// AND NOTHING IN A TASK ASKS THIS KEYBOARD A QUESTION. A node's policy allows
// everything but the floor and the floor refuses rather than prompts, so a
// consent request and a task proposal reach the chat and never a room — the one

// A ROOM USED TO LOOK LIKE THE CONVERSATION. Same rows, same hues, same box
// underneath, and the only two things saying otherwise were a word in the legend
// and a placeholder in the box — both of which are read once and then stop being
// read. A person who walked into a node, scrolled, and looked up two minutes
// later had nothing on screen telling them that the sentence they were about to
// type was going to a worktree somewhere else.
//
// So the room pins its own rows at the top of the body region, under the tab
// strip (chattabs.go). They are pinned rather than scrolled for the reason a
// status line is pinned — a fact that scrolls away is a fact that is only true
// at the top of the page.
//
// ── AND THEY ARE TWO ROWS, WHICH THEY WERE NOT ──────────────────────────────
//
// One row carried all of it: the state glyph, then the trail, then the state
// word, the clock, the spend, the call count and the model, joined with the same
// `·` the trail's own steps were joined with and painted in the one accent the
// whole line wore. So the ancestry a person came to read ran into telemetry with
// no seam between them, the loudest ink on the page was spent on figures, and
// the path — the thing the row exists for — was the part that got cut first when
// the frame narrowed.
//
// THE TRAIL ROW IS NOW ANCESTRY AND NOTHING ELSE: "main ▸ parent ▸ child", the
// way out at its right end, and no glyph, no money, no model. THE FACTS ROW
// UNDER IT is what the work is doing — the state in its own semantic ink, the
// rest in the dim every other piece of telemetry on this surface wears — and it
// ends in `Stop`, spelled out, which is the one control anywhere on the surface
// that ends work with a pointer.
//
// NAVIGATION OUTRANKS TELEMETRY WHEN THE FRAME IS NARROW, and the split is what
// makes that true by construction rather than by negotiation: the trail gets its
// whole row, and the facts degrade on their own row by the ranked prefix every
// list on this surface already uses (rowfit.go's law 3).
//
// THE TRAIL IS A BREADCRUMB and it always names the root: "main ▸ <node>" one
// level down, "main ▸ parent ▸ child" when a node's page grows a door into the
// node it spawned. The root is on it even at one level deep because the trail's
// job is to say what this page hangs off, and "main" is the one name this
// surface has for the conversation itself.

// roomHeadFloor is the narrowest frame that gets a pinned header at all: under

// A ROOM USED TO STOP SAYING ANYTHING THE MOMENT YOU TYPED. The placeholder
// named the node — and a placeholder is the one thing in a box that disappears
// the instant somebody uses it, so the row that said "these words are going to a
// worktree somewhere else" said it only to people who had not started. Everything
// else on the frame that knew was somewhere the eye was not: the header at the
// top, the legend under the transcript, the status line at the bottom.
//
// So the box itself carries the room, as one segment in front of its prompt: the
// node's state cell and the node's name, lifted off the page on the selection
// tint and painted in the state's own hue ([app.taskStateInk] — the hue the
// roster paints the same node's glyph with, so the row that is banded in the
// column and the name in front of the caret are the same colour for the same
// reason). It is where a person's eye already is, it is there whether the box is
// empty or full, and it is gone the moment there is no room — the emptiness law:
// there is no segment in the conversation, not a dim one and not an empty one.
//
// IT IS A SEGMENT AND NOT A ROW. A row above the box would be a row taken off
// the transcript on every frame of every room, for a fact three cells can carry.
