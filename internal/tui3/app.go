	// simply keeps the authored ladder it has been painting since the first
	// frame. There is no timer behind it and no fallback path to take, because
	// the fallback is what is already on screen.

	// raised while nobody was attached has been holding that turn since; this is
	// the moment somebody arrived, so it is the moment to be handed it
	// (hostlink.go's [app.askHeld]). It is nil on every local session, which is

	// round trip to measure and because no frame is permission to call the wire.

// ── THE SECOND STAGE, AND WHY IT IS A CLOCK RATHER THAN A KEY ───────────────
//
// The window above used to be UNBOUNDED, and this block used to argue that it
// had to be. The argument was sound and it is kept below, because both halves of
// it are still true and the second one is what dictated how this was built. What
// changed is that the thing it said did not exist now does.
//
// WHAT THE ARGUMENT GOT RIGHT, FIRST HALF: THERE IS NO KEY LEFT. esc's grammar
// in the conversation is read in a fixed order (input.go, rewind.go): a recall
// walk takes it, then [app.escRewind] — where the first esc ARMS the rewind on
// its way past and a second one inside [rewindArmWindow] OPENS it — and only
// then [app.interrupt]. So every esc that lands within half a second of another
// esc already belongs to rewind, and THE INTERRUPT IS NOT FOR SALE cuts the
// other way just as hard. Putting a hard stop AFTER the window does not save it
// either, because an esc past the window is a FIRST esc again, so the key would
// mean "stop harder" or "open the rewind" depending on what the person did half
// a second later — one keypress with two readings, which is the one thing this
// keyboard cannot have. ctrl+c is spoken for on both sides of the same moment:
// mid-turn it is the interrupt, and at rest — which is what winding down IS —
// it is the door (leaving.go).
//
// THAT REMAINS TRUE, SO THE SECOND STAGE TAKES NO KEY AT ALL. It is a CLOCK,
// started by the esc the person already pressed, and it needs no grammar because
// it asks for no gesture. A person who wants a turn to stop has said so once;
// making them say it twice, harder, into a surface that already heard them is
// the exact experience issue #265 was filed about.
//
// WHAT THE ARGUMENT GOT RIGHT, SECOND HALF, AND WHY IT DICTATED THE ORDER OF
// WORK: A CAPABILITY THAT CANNOT WORK IS ABSENT, NOT BROKEN. A deadline whose
// only act was to look away would be the worst possible thing to put under a
// person's stop — a surface saying "detached" over a goroutine that keeps
// spending. So the door was built from the bottom up before this clock was
// wired to anything, in the order the old block itself named:
//
//   - the jobs registry's SIGTERM and SIGKILL graces take the call's context
//     (session's jobs.go, [waitDoneUnder]);
//   - bash's wait has a cancellation arm that hands back what the command had
//     already written and lets the reaper finish behind it (internal/exec/bare);
//   - the tool batch's `wg.Wait()` has a second stage of its own, cut by an
//     abandon signal rather than by the turn's context, so an ordinary stop
//     still gives every tool the seconds it needs to hand back what it did
//     (session's loop.go and abandon.go's [waitBatch]);
//   - and [session.Agent.Abandon] is the door onto all of them, which also cuts
//     the turn's context a second time — aborting whatever HTTP is in flight,
//     since every provider request is built on it — closes the turn's hub so
//     this surface is genuinely free, and writes ONE journal line marking the
//     turn abandoned with its last known spend.
//
// THE JOURNAL LINE IS THE POINT AND NOT THE DECORATION. A turn nobody waits for
// is a turn that never writes the seal carrying its cost, so without that line a
// turn let go of at the bound would be money spent with no record that anything
// had been let go of. The money itself already reaches the machine's ledger per
// call rather than per turn (session's usage_ledger.go), so the bill is not lost
// — what would have been lost is the fact.
//
// WHAT A PERSON READS while the clock runs is [app.stoppingSegment]: the status
// line says `stopping` as it always did, and beside it, how long until the
// surface detaches. A silent countdown is not a stop anybody can trust, so the
// bound is on the screen before it fires and never only after.

// stopGrace is HOW LONG A STOP WAITS FOR THE ENGINE before the surface lets go
// of the turn without it ([app.stopSweep]).
//
// TEN SECONDS, AND THE FIGURE IS ARGUED RATHER THAN PICKED. It is NOT argued
// from bash's three-second `WaitDelay` or the `jobs` kill's two-plus-two second
// graces any more: this change put the call's context on both of those, so a
// stop ends them at once rather than waiting them out. What is left behind the
// bound is the class this change cannot reach from outside — a wait that never
// looks at its context at all, a command whose output a grandchild still holds,
// anything a tool blocks on that was written before cancellation existed. Ten
// seconds is chosen to sit far above every settle we can measure, so the
// deadline fires only on that class and never on a turn that was about to end
// tidily and hand back what it did.
//
// IT IS MEASURED FROM THE KEYPRESS and not from the last event, because the key
// is the only moment the person is timing from.

// has not closed yet: the seconds between a person's esc and the engine letting

// IT IS A REAL WINDOW, THOUGH IT IS NO LONGER A LONG ONE FOR ORDINARY WORK.
// [session.Agent.Interrupt] cancels the turn's context and returns at once, and
// since this change the tool batch's wait and the jobs graces take that context
// too, so the ordinary settle is now the time a cancelled call needs to unwind.
// The window survives because the turn goroutine does not close its
// event hub until [session.Agent]'s loop returns, and the loop cannot look at
// the context until the tool batch it is inside has finished. What can still
// outlast the cancel is the context-blind class — a wait that never looks at the
// context it was given — and that is what the bound is for. [stopGrace] above
// carries the argument in full; it is not repeated here, so that moving the
// reasoning cannot leave two versions of it disagreeing.

// ── the paste bracket ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE BUG THIS FIXES, AND WHY IT WAS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE.
//
// Bracketed paste is on (view.go) and the parser usually hands the whole paste
// over as one tea.PasteMsg, which this surface has always handled. The comment
// at the bottom of input.go's key router claimed the other case was covered too:
//
//	// A key event carrying a newline is a paste on a terminal that does not
//	// speak bracketed paste (or one whose paste arrived as keystrokes). It
//	// is inserted as typed — the newlines are the person's.
//
// That was FALSE, and it was false in the one direction that costs something. A
// newline never reaches that line: it arrives as a key whose name is "enter",
// and "enter" is matched twelve cases higher up, where it SUBMITS. So a paste
// that arrived as keystrokes did not become a multi-line draft — it sent the
// first line to the model, then the second, then the third. Ten lines of a stack
// trace became ten turns. The fallback the comment described could not run,
// because the key it was written for was taken before it.
//
// Keys leak between the brackets more often than the coalescing path suggests:
// the parser gives up on its buffer and passes an event through when a sequence
// inside a paste does not decode, and win32-input and the kitty protocol encode
// the newlines in a paste as key events by construction.
//
// So the fix is not a better fallback. It is to trust the BRACKET rather than
// the coalescing: PasteStartMsg opens it, everything until PasteEndMsg is text —
// keys included, read before every other claim on the keyboard — and the close
// spends the whole of it as one edit. Nothing between the brackets can submit,
// interrupt, answer a question, or open an overlay, because nothing between the
// brackets is a keystroke: it is a document somebody copied.

// pasteGrace is how long an open bracket may go quiet before it is treated as
// abandoned.
//
// It exists because the alternative is a dead keyboard. A terminal that sends
// the open and then dies, a paste cut short by a disconnect, a multiplexer that
// swallows the close — any of them would leave this surface reading every key as
// text forever, which is the one failure worse than the one being fixed. Two
// seconds is far longer than the gap between two keys of the same paste (they

// approvalPosture is the gate's posture as the YOLO segment may state it: an

// drawn only when the gate is open (render.go's NEGATIVE-SPACE SAFETY), so its
// ABSENCE is the claim that every tool call will be asked about — and the gate
// it is claiming about is the one cmd/codeaf built from
// [config.ToolApprovalModeAt] on the very same profile directory (chatv3.go's
// v3Policy). The two must be one reading, because a segment that is quiet over
// an open gate is the surface telling somebody they will be asked before their
// disk is written to, and then not asking.
//
// IT WAS NOT ONE READING. This resolved through a helper that answered "" on an
// empty [app.profileDir], on the reasoning that a surface booted without a
// profile has not been told the gate is open. But AN EMPTY PROFILE DIRECTORY IS
// THE NORMAL CASE, NOT THE ABSENT CASE: CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR is the rare export,
// the empty string has always meant this process's own profile in the state
// root ([config.ProfilePath]), and the policy the tools actually ran under read
// that profile. So a person who had turned the asking off — the one posture
// this segment exists to remind them of — was shown NOTHING on every ordinary
// launch while their gate stood open (#322). The profile is read here the way
// every other persisted row on this surface is read.
//
// THE PROFILE ROW IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT OPENS THIS GATE. `codeaf chat
// --yolo` replaces the gate's default for the session and writes nothing down
// (cmd/codeaf's v3Policy), so a surface that read only the profile drew nothing
// over a gate that was open for the whole run (#325). The launch hands that
// posture down instead, and a launch that hands nothing down is read from the
// profile, live, as before. Locally the handed-down answer can ONLY ever be
// `allow`: a posture handed down that silenced the segment would make the same
// false claim by the other route.
//
// THE HOSTED WINDOW IS STILL THE ONE ABSENCE. This machine's profile is not the
// session's posture over --host: the gate that decides whether a tool runs
// without asking is the ENGINE's, read from the profile on the engine's
// machine. A YOLO badge drawn from this laptop's settings would be a safety
// claim about a machine nobody consulted, so a remote session reads
// [app.handedApproval] — the same answer, asked of the right machine
