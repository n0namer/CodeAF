// THE TASKS PLACE, app side: one thin state struct and the handful of things a
// place has to be able to do.
//
// The READING is next door in tasksplace.go and is pure — data, a window, a
// width and a palette in, rows out. This file is everything that needs the
// surface: taking the snapshot, holding the cursor and the scroll, answering the
// keyboard and the pointer, and handing the frame its rows. taskview.go keeps
// what is NOT the place — the record card's mode, the other-windows reading, and
// the one door the roster's column has onto here.
//
// The methods on [tasksPlace] are shaped for the `place` contract the switcher is
// settling into (docs/design/home-rethink/ARCHITECTURE.md): close, body, stops,
// enter, window, note, hint, changed. Where the rest of the surface already
// spells one of them under an older name, that name survives beside it as a
// one-line call — the seam the refactor lane deletes when the interface lands,
// and never a second copy of the logic.

// tasksPlace is the whole of the place's state. The zero value is closed.
//
// THE CURSOR AND THE OFFSET ARE BOTH LINE INDEXES into the layout the reading
// lays out ([tasksReading.lay]), which is what makes the paint and the pointer
// agree: one walk decides which screen line carries which piece of work, and the
// cursor is a line of that walk rather than a count of items the frame would
// have to re-derive.

	//
	// A KEY THAT IS NOT HERE IS THE ROW'S OWN DEFAULT AND NOT `SHUT`
	// ([tasksReading.opens] holds the two defaults and says why they differ). So
	// nil is the page as it opens — every conversation showing its work, every

// would go on withholding the word [taskRecordStoppedWord] from the row that
// deserves it.
//
// AND THIS WINDOW'S OWN GRAPH IS THE SECOND AUTHORITY, for the same reason and
// with more force away from home. A task started while the page is up — by the
// model, or by somebody typing `/task` — has no row in any file yet; it exists
// only as a node on this surface's rail, which [app.taskSheetMine] folds in. Over
