// ── THE BREADCRUMB BAR: WHERE YOU ARE, THE WHOLE WAY DOWN ───────────────────
//
// The top row of the frame answers one question and it is the first question a
// person has when they look up: WHICH PAGE IS THIS. Until this file it answered
// half of it. The trail was built over [app.roomPath], which was the open room's
// own title and nothing else, so a task three levels inside a family drew the
// same two crumbs as a task the conversation had asked for directly —
//
//	main ▸ Cut the goldens
//
// — while the ancestry the engine had modelled all along sat one row underneath
// in the kin block, spelled as a fact (`part of: Write the tree`) rather than as
// a place, and only ever ONE level of it. The page knew who its parent was and
// said so in a sentence you could not press.
//
// So the trail is now the ACTUAL CHAIN, root first:
//
//	main ▸ Ship the port ▸ Write the tree ▸ Cut the goldens
//
// and every step of it but the last is a DOOR. The last one is the page you are
// standing on and is inert — a crumb that reopened the page you are already on
// is a control that does nothing, and the surface does not draw those.
//
// ── THE FOUR LAWS THIS FILE HOLDS ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  1. NO CRUMB IS INVENTED. A step is drawn only where this window can name the
//     work behind it. An ancestor whose node this surface has had no update for
//     ends the walk — the same refusal the kin line already made about a parent
//     it could not name ("part of: 7" has told a person nothing), applied to
//     every level rather than to one.
//
//  2. A CRUMB IS A DOOR ONLY WHERE A DOOR EXISTS THAT LANDS EXACTLY ON IT. The
//     root of a task page is `main` and its door is [app.closeRoom], which is
//     the conversation this window is sitting in. An ancestor's door is
//     [app.openRailRoom], which is the same door the roster's own row is. A page
//     read through ANOTHER conversation has neither: its ancestors belong to a
//     graph this window may not touch, and its root is somebody else's
//     conversation that `esc` does not lead to. Those crumbs are drawn and do
//     nothing, because a capability that cannot work is absent, not broken.
//
//  3. THE ROOT AND THE PAGE YOU ARE ON SURVIVE THE NARROWEST FRAME. What gives
//     way as the terminal narrows is the middle of the chain, and it gives way
//     to `…` — never to silence. A trail that quietly dropped two ancestors
//     would be a trail that says this work hangs off the conversation, which is
//     the one thing it exists to deny.
//
//  4. THE `…` IS A DOOR TOO, AND IT OPENS THE NEAREST THING IT HID. Pressing it
//     opens the IMMEDIATE PARENT — one step up, the step a person reaching for
//     a folded crumb almost always wants, and the crumb that would reappear
//     first if the terminal grew. An ellipsis standing for ancestors that are
//     all inert (a guest page) is inert with them.

// The crumb bar's own alphabet. The separator and the root word are room.go's
// ([roomCrumbSep], [roomCrumbRoot]) because this is the same trail it has always
// drawn, with the middle filled in.
