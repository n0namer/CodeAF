// THE JOBS SECTION ON THE COLUMN.
//
// THE LAW THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: a background job is not a task, and the
// column that used to file one among the families now keeps a section of its
// own for it. The reading is pure (jobsview.go). This file is the window's
// half — it reads [app.jobs], holds the toggle, routes a key and a click onto
// the label or a row, and asks the reading for the lines.
//
// IT DRAWS NOTHING ITSELF. A string a person sees is formatted from the
// notice's fields at the width the column has, in jobsview.go, so a test can
// pin the four collapsed shapes with no window and no terminal.

// jobSection is this conversation's jobs as the column draws them, or nil
// when there are none — which is the emptiness law, not an empty heading.
