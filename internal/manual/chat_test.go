// RETRIEVAL IS THE FEATURE, NOT THE PAGES.
//
// The chat manual is only worth having if a question asked in a person's own
// words reaches the page that answers it. Pages that are complete and correct
// and unreachable are pages the chat will talk over the top of, improvising
// exactly as it would with no manual at all.
//
// So the corpus is tested the way it is used: real questions, in the words
// somebody would actually type, against the number of sections the belt tool
// actually hands the model ([DefaultResults]). A question that stops reaching
// its page is a regression in the manual even when every page still reads well,
// and it is usually fixed by writing the asker's words into a heading rather
// than by touching this list.
